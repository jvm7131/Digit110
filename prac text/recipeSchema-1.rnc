# DIGIT 110 RELAX NG PRE-TEST HOMEWORK INSTRUCTIONS:  
# * You're downloading two files: Rename these files according to our standard file naming conventions for Canvas submissions (as in: beshero-rng4.xml and beshero-rng4.rnc)
# * Make the schema well-formed and document with  # comments where you made change(s). 
# * Then, associate the schema with the XML file we have provided for the exam.
# * Next, correct the schema code so that it validates the XML (happy green oXygen for both documents) and document briefly with # comments what you changed and why.
#  **NOTE**: DO NOT CHANGE the markup in the XML file, except to add your schema line!
#
# TIPS: 
# There are 13 critical errors in this Relax-NG schema that will make oXygen's error-checking box RED. Only a few of them will appear at first in the Relax NG. 
# More errors will be revealed when you associate the schema with the XML file.
# Your goal is to correct each of these errors.

# First, correct the schema file so it "turns green" in oXygen and write a comment to document each correction.
# Then, associate your corrected  schema with the XML (and remove the original schema line). 
# At that point the other validation errors will become evident in the XML file.)
# Remember to split your oXygen screen (Window -> Tile Editors Vertically), and carefully examine the XML to see how 
# the elements are written. 
# DO NOT CHANGE THE MARKUP IN THE XML FILE. Make ALL corrections in the Relax NG Schema to make the XML valid according to the schema.
# Save the schema and use the red checkmark in oXygen to check the validation as you go.
#
# SUBMITTING YOUR WORK:
# When you are finished, upload BOTH the schema and the XML file to Canvas using the posted upload point for this exam. 
# You may zip the files to submit them just as you have done for homework assignments.
